# AutoFish Module

A clean, modular auto-fishing feature for Minecraft Fabric 1.21.5 inspired by FishMaster.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Automatic Fishing**: Automatically casts, detects bites, and reels in fish
- **Armor Stand Detection**: Detects the "!!!" armor stand indicator for fish bites (Hypixel Skyblock compatible)
- **Smart Rod Management**: Automatically switches to fishing rod in inventory
- **State Machine Logic**: Clean IDLE → CASTING → FISHING state transitions
- **Mouse Ungrab**: Optional feature to allow background usage without locking cursor
- **Sea Creature Killer**: Automatically attacks sea creatures when they spawn during fishing

### Sea Creature Killer
- **Auto-Combat**: Detects and attacks sea creatures within 6 block radius
- **Smart Weapon Switching**: Switches to weapon, attacks, then switches back to fishing rod
- **79+ Target Creatures**: Supports all Hypixel Skyblock sea creatures (Water, Oasis, Spooky, Winter, Shark, Swamp, Lava)
- **Kill Counter**: Tracks total kills during session
- **Seamless Integration**: Automatically pauses fishing during combat, resumes after

### Humanization
- **Randomized Timing**: Configurable delays with variance to appear more human-like
- **Recast Delay**: Customizable wait time between casts (default 10 ticks / 500ms ± 20%)
- **Reeling Delay**: Customizable reaction time when fish bites (default 6 ticks / 300ms ± 15%)
- **Detection Cooldown**: 50ms cooldown to prevent multiple detections of the same bite
- **Combat Cooldown**: 350ms attack cooldown (~2.8 attacks per second)

## Commands

All commands start with `/fish`:

### Control Commands
- `/fish` - Shows current status and configuration
- `/fish start` - Starts auto fishing
- `/fish stop` - Stops auto fishing
- `/fish sck <true|false>` - Enables/disables Sea Creature Killer
  - Example: `/fish sck true` (enables automatic sea creature combat)
  - Accepts: true/false, yes/no, on/off, 1/0

### Configuration Commands
- `/fish keybind <keycode>` - Sets keybind for toggling auto fishing
  - Example: `/fish keybind 82` (sets R key)
  - Find keycodes at: https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__keys.html

- `/fish ungrab <true|false>` - Enables/disables mouse ungrab feature
  - Example: `/fish ungrab true` (allows background usage)
  - Accepts: true/false, yes/no, on/off, 1/0

- `/fish recastdelay <ticks>` - Sets delay between casts (2-50 ticks)
  - Example: `/fish recastdelay 15` (750ms)
  - 1 tick = 50ms, default is 10 ticks

- `/fish reelingdelay <ticks>` - Sets delay after detecting bite (2-15 ticks)
  - Example: `/fish reelingdelay 8` (400ms)
  - 1 tick = 50ms, default is 6 ticks

## Architecture

### Module Structure
```
red.client.fishing/
├── FishingMod.java              # Main entry point, initializes module
├── command/
│   └── FishCommand.java         # Command registration and handlers
├── config/
│   └── FishConfig.java          # JSON config management
├── feature/
│   ├── AutoFishingFeature.java  # Core fishing logic and state machine
│   └── SeaCreatureKiller.java   # Sea creature detection and combat
├── keybind/
│   └── FishKeybindings.java     # Keybind registration and handling
└── util/
    └── FishMouseSimulator.java  # Right-click simulation utility
```

### Design Patterns
- **State Machine**: Clean state transitions (IDLE → CASTING → FISHING)
- **Singleton Pattern**: Static feature instance for global access
- **Configuration Management**: Persistent JSON config with Gson
- **Event-Driven**: Fabric's ClientTickEvents for main loop
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each class has single, clear responsibility

### Key Components

#### AutoFishingFeature.java
- **tick()**: Main game loop integration, called every tick
- **toggle()**: Starts/stops fishing with validation checks
- **State Machine**: Manages IDLE, CASTING, FISHING states
- **detectArmorStandFishBite()**: Scans for "!!!" armor stand within 50 blocks
- **hasBobberInWater()**: Validates bobber is in water or lava
- **switchToFishingRod()**: Automatically finds and equips fishing rod

#### SeaCreatureKiller.java
- **tick()**: Scans for and attacks sea creatures during fishing
- **enterCombat()**: Switches to weapon and begins attacking target
- **exitCombat()**: Returns to fishing rod after kill
- **findNearestTargetCreature()**: Scans 6 block radius for sea creatures
- **isTargetSeaCreature()**: Validates entity is attackable sea creature
- **30+ Target Creatures**: Comprehensive list of Hypixel Skyblock sea creatures

#### FishMouseSimulator.java
- Uses MouseMixin interface to access private Mouse methods
- Simulates authentic right-click with 10-30ms press duration
- Thread-safe implementation with proper error handling

#### FishConfig.java
- Saves to `config/autofish.json`
- Stores: keybind, ungrab, recast delay, reeling delay, SCK enabled
- Hot-reloading support
- Type-safe getters/setters with automatic save

## Detection Logic

### Fish Bite Detection
The module uses Hypixel Skyblock's armor stand indicator system:
1. Scans for ArmorStandEntity in world
2. Checks if entity has custom name "!!!"
3. Validates distance is within 50 blocks
4. Applies 50ms cooldown to prevent double-detection

### Bobber Validation
- Checks `player.fishHook != null` for active bobber
- Validates `fishHook.isTouchingWater()` or `isInLava()`
- Monitors bobber state continuously during FISHING phase

## Timing Configuration

### Understanding Ticks
- 1 tick = 50 milliseconds
- 20 ticks = 1 second
- All delays use randomization for human-like behavior

### Recommended Settings
- **Fast Fishing**: recastDelay=5, reelingDelay=3
- **Normal (Default)**: recastDelay=10, reelingDelay=6
- **Cautious**: recastDelay=15, reelingDelay=8

## Integration

### Fabric Mod Integration
The module is registered as a client entrypoint in `fabric.mod.json`:
```json
"client": [
  "red.client.fishing.FishingMod"
]
```

### Mixin Dependencies
Reuses the existing MouseAccessorMixin from FlareCombatMacro for mouse simulation.

### No Conflicts
- Uses separate package namespace: `red.client.fishing`
- Separate config file: `autofish.json`
- Independent command tree: `/fish`
- No shared state with other modules

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
1. Hold or have fishing rod in inventory
2. Run `/fish start` or press configured keybind
3. Module will automatically cast, detect bites, and reel in fish

### With Sea Creature Killer
1. Enable SCK: `/fish sck true`
2. Start fishing: `/fish start`
3. Module will fish normally, but automatically attack sea creatures when they spawn
4. Kills are tracked and displayed in status: `/fish` to view kill count

### Background Fishing (Mouse Ungrab)
1. Enable ungrab: `/fish ungrab true`
2. Start fishing: `/fish start`
3. You can now Alt-Tab or use other windows while fishing continues

### Custom Timing
```
/fish recastdelay 12    # Wait 600ms between casts
/fish reelingdelay 7    # React to bites in 350ms
/fish sck true          # Enable sea creature killer
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No fishing rod found in inventory"
- Ensure you have a fishing rod in your inventory or hands
- Check that the rod has durability remaining

### Fishing stops unexpectedly
- Check chat for error messages
- Verify fishing rod is still in inventory
- Ensure bobber landed in water/lava

### Sea Creature Killer not attacking
- Ensure SCK is enabled: `/fish sck true`
- Verify you have a weapon (sword/axe) in hotbar
- Check that sea creatures are within 6 block range
- Confirm auto fishing is running

### Keybind not working
- Verify keybind code with `/fish` status command
- Check for conflicts with other mods
- Try setting a different key

## Performance

- **CPU Usage**: Minimal, only active during fishing
- **Memory**: ~100KB for module state
- **Network**: No additional network calls
- **Tick Budget**: <1ms per tick when active

## Safety Features

- **Rod Validation**: Stops if fishing rod disappears
- **Null Checks**: Comprehensive null safety for client/player/world
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles disconnects and world changes
- **Config Backup**: Auto-saves on shutdown
